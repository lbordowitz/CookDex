Cooking notes!

What do we want a recipe to consist of? Actually, suppose you have a bunch of sauted onions already. Do you need to make more sauted onions?

Here's an idea: how about we take recipes, and we represent them in a more computer style?

https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/easy_shepherds_pie/

1 Boil the potatoes
PeeledPotatoes = Peel Potatoes
QuarteredPotatoes  = Quarter PeeledPotatoes
BoiledPotatoes = *Boil QuarteredPotatoes, in "1 inch of water" with salt, for 20 minutes
// We don't do this next one yet:
// MashedPotatoes = Mash BoiledPotatoes

That covers the first step. Of those steps, all of them are mechanical alterations except for boiling. And boiling is the most complicated: The recipe specifically says to cover the potatoes in an inch of cold water in a medium-sized pot, then bring to a boil, salt the water, and continue boiling for 20 miuntes.

But we've already figured a couple things out:
 - The tree-like structure of a recipe can be traversed in a post-order method, which is very, very pleasant and natural.
 - Leaves of the recipe tree are raw ingredients. Nodes are ingredient phases, which, of course, can be subbed if they're already made (this is the point you made earlier!).
 - Inner-nodes consist of the base raw ingredients, along with a cooking verb, I think we should call that a technique.

We should do some baking recipe next... Anyway!

2. Saute vegetables
ChoppedOnions = Chop Onions
SautedOnions = Saute Onions, in 4tbsp butter, on medium, for 6 to 10 minutes
SautedOnionsAndCarrots = Saute Onions and carrots, in 4tbsp butter, on medium, for 6 to 10 minutes
SautedVegetables = Saute (SautedOnions or SautedOnionsAndCarrots), on medium, with (corn or peas or both), for 1 minute

Notes about step:
 - The literal first five words: "While the potatoes are cooking". In other words, there is a scheduling problem involved in cooking! Wow.
 - There are optional carrot steps.
 - There's so much creativity in how many veggies you could saute, and for how long. While there isn't one single correct way to saute vegetables, there is a best way for a particular recipe. it needs to be cooked enough to make sure each ingredient is soft, but not overcooked, but also that their flavors are mixed together.

3. 
BeefAndVegetables = PanCook RawGroundBeef and SautedVegetables, on medium, until beef is no longer pink.
SeasonedBeefAndVegetables = SeasonDry BeefAndVegetables with Salt+Pepper
PreShepherdsPieFilling = Add SeasonedBeefAndVegetables and Worcestershire sauce and beef Broth
ShepherdsPieFilling = Simmer, uncovered, PreShepherdsPieFilling, for 10 minutes

4.
MashedPotatoes = Mash BoiledPotatoes and 4 Tbsp butter
SeasonedMashedPotatoes = Season MashedPotatoes with Salt+Pepper

5.
UncookedShepherdsPie = Layer ShepherdsPieFilling, then SeasonedMashedPotatoes, in casserole

6.
ShepheredPie = Bake, at 400, UncookedShepherdsPie, for 30 minutes

There's an optional bit about broiling the shepherds pie. I like to cover with aluminum foil and then broil a bit later.

There are a bunch of variations. First off, I have much more seasoned mashed taters, with garlic powder and mustard powder in it, or heavy cream instead of butter. The recipe itself mentions creamed corn as an in-between layer, as well as grated cheese on top of the potatoes.

So far, in our data structure:
 - Raw Ingredients
 - Cooking Techniques
 - Recipe Trees
 - Recipe Templates
 - Variations, with tree modification diffs
 - Cookware

Some very cool things about this representation:
 - Raw ingredient listings, and their amounts, can be derived from leaves of the tree
 - After a fashion, so could total cook time, although there's a scheduling problem there

Keeping our eyes on the prize:

WHAT SETS THIS APART FROM ANY OTHER COOKBOOK?

It is an index of cooking techniques, with recipes organized and structured around the techniques themselves. They exist to be simplified, complicated, dressed up, and remixed. Creativity of recipes can be captured in a structured way.

We want to do this for:
 - Beginner cooks, who want simple versions of their favorite recipes: maybe there's a simplify version
 - Amateur home cooks who know a thing or two, but want to learn a new technique
 - Home cooks who have some ingredients, but don't know what to make for dinner tonight
 - Seasoned (lol) cooks who want to try their hand at recipe making.
 - ME! I'm doing this for me! I want my perfect cookbook, made in my image. I want recipes that are structured in the same way that I think of cooking.

TODO for cooking data structure: 
 - Figure out boiling, sauteing, baking, and other "complicated" cooking steps.
 - How to capture that something should all be done in the same pan, between steps?
 - Literally the kitchen utensils and cookware needs to be represented
 - Recipe templates?
 - Representing variations as tree diffs!
 - The scheduling problem ("while the potatoes are boiling" and "mash potatoes while gravy is simmering" steps are nontrivial)
 - And, of course, making this into actual code!
