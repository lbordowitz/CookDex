Two ideas:
 - How about we make cooking techniques act more like verbs?
 - Can we use some sort of "Decorator pattern" to add the "in y" part to "<verb> x *in y*" cooking instructions?

So, Technique is something like boil, saute, etc. It has a method Cook. It's a more object-oriented way to handle than very large constructors.
