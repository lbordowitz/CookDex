Two ideas:
 - How about we make cooking techniques act more like verbs?
 - Can we use some sort of "Decorator pattern" to add the "in y" part to "<verb> x *in y*" cooking instructions?

So, Technique is something like boil, saute, etc. It has a method Cook. It's a more object-oriented way to handle than very large constructors.

Oh! Another thing, I think I made this point about time earlier:
 - Mechanical techniques track the amount of time the Person cooking needs to execute the action
 - Chemical/Heat/Cooking techniques track the amount of time the Food needs to cook for to get the desired result

A subtle, but important difference. The Mechanical time is usually not tracked very well; some people have knife skills for days, others might take a little more time to chop things up.

Before doing decorator, let's try to go thru the tree, pre-order traversal.
Wow. That was easy, and given how simplified I made this, I'm surprised the recipe is remotely comprehensible. Great Job!

Now that the recipe is displaying, in full, let's add some nice bits and bobs here and there to make it easier to read.
For instance, we can utilize the fact that there's an ingredient reference name and a display separately to provide an ingredient listing.

Okay... I included an ingredient listing. It's okay. One of the problems: it lists the butter ingredient twice, rather than combining them.
This is because we use butter in two situations: 1/4 cup for mashed potatoes, and 1/4 cup for sauteing the onions.

Is there a go package that does human-readable "and" lists? Yes, conjoin

Well, it's still far from perfect, but it's better than yesterday. Let's keep track of what needs to be done, still.
 - Scheduling problem: a smarter order for displaying the recipe, and maybe some sort of meanwhile.
 - Easier way of entering recipes (possibly automatic, GPT3+DLNN for recipe book -> recipe tree?)
   - I'd settle for an easier way to code them.
   - I still haven't done a satisfactory decorator, maybe that's up for tomorrow!
 - Variations/Optional Steps/"Tree edits"
 - Cookware

I also imagine that each of the data structures, like ingredients and techniques, are enriched with human-readable, localized "wiki" information on the particular technique or ingredient. Maybe with food science about it, or information about why something is done one way or another.
