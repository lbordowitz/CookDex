Two ideas:
 - How about we make cooking techniques act more like verbs?
 - Can we use some sort of "Decorator pattern" to add the "in y" part to "<verb> x *in y*" cooking instructions?

So, Technique is something like boil, saute, etc. It has a method Cook. It's a more object-oriented way to handle than very large constructors.

Oh! Another thing, I think I made this point about time earlier:
 - Mechanical techniques track the amount of time the Person cooking needs to execute the action
 - Chemical/Heat/Cooking techniques track the amount of time the Food needs to cook for to get the desired result

A subtle, but important difference. The Mechanical time is usually not tracked very well; some people have knife skills for days, others might take a little more time to chop things up.

Before doing decorator, let's try to go thru the tree, pre-order traversal.
Wow. That was easy, and given how simplified I made this, I'm surprised the recipe is remotely comprehensible. Great Job!
