Here's a thought: the main algorithms in this project involve Natural Language Processing and Understanding.

Consider the tasks we might want to do with a user:
 - Provide them step-by-step instructions on a recipe
 - Simplifying existing recipes

Additionally:
 - Instructing on new techniques
 - Finding recipes using only food in the pantry

While those last two can be derived fairly straight-forwardly from the recipe tree, the other two imply a dynamic generation of localized text. In other words, the recipe trees should be able to yield multiple human-readable representations: a full recipe, step-by-step instructions with voice (maybe a smart home speaker tool?) and dynamically generating recipe instructions from the simpler tree.

Two other tasks involve understanding:
 - Help them develop their own recipe, either by guided variation or from scratch
 - Read recipes online and make trees.

That involves NLP. We could possibly use GPT-3 to read and understand recipes online, with the potential of translating them into trees! Wouldn't that be swell.

Those are more long-term thoughts. We have more urgent matters to attend to.

We have a couple of things that can be done more immediately:
 - Use the "Effective Go" guide to rewrite a lot of this code, so that it's "nicer".
 - Extract a "data model".
 - Make an API, based on the user stories above.

After all those three are done, we can get on to the less Go-centric part:
 - Use the API in a web UI

Let's go for it.

I'm adding a little documentation, as a note of "this is what you should do to make nice Godoc pages." However, I'm not completing the whole thing yet; I'm not sure whether the functions or structures I have are the "right" ones. Hmmm, I'm of two minds about this:
 - I can write documentation now: this will clear my head in terms of what the objects do and their structure. It also gives practice for technical writing.
 - I can write documentation later: in the very likely event that the structure of the code changes, I don't have to delete a ton of writing.

I think I'll do it later, at least waiting until after I'm done with the rest of the Effective Go guide.
